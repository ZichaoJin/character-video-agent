        "Core Narrative Structure": "The synopsis presents two distinct settings: an art gallery and a home kitchen. These settings form the basis for the two main acts, each depicting a slice of life and emphasizing the parent-child relationship. The transition between these acts is marked by a change in setting and activity.",
        "Key Character Information": "The main characters are \u5e03\u5e03 and \u4e00\u4e8c, a parent and child. Their relationship is central to the narrative, with their interactions in both the art gallery and kitchen highlighting their bond. \u5e03\u5e03 guides and interacts with \u4e00\u4e8c, who is curious and eager to learn.",
        "Temporal Segmentation": "The synopsis does not specify explicit time cues, but the settings suggest a progression from daytime at the art gallery to later in the day at home. This natural flow creates a temporal segmentation.",
        "Sub-Script Breakdown Criteria": "Each sub-script is divided based on changes in setting or activity, ensuring each segment is self-contained and at least 50 words. The division is guided by the narrative's natural breaks and the proposed camera shots.",
        "Division": "The division occurs at logical transition points: entering the art gallery, interactions within it, transitioning to the kitchen, and activities there. Each sub-script captures a complete scene or thematic focus."
